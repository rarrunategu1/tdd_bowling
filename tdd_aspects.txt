Research the aspects of Test Driven Development

Take some time and investigate the aspects of Test Driven 
Development. What kind of tests are there? What are some 
good rules to creating tests? How do you determine a good test.

Test Driven Development is based on testing your code as you go.  
The first step is to write a test that defines a function or 
improvements of a function (also known as a test case) while understanding 
the feature's requirements.After writing your new test, you run 
it to see if it passes.  If it fails you write some code that will allow 
the test to pass.  Take it 1 to 10 edits at a time.  Only seconds or a couple 
minutes of your time should be taken before running tests.  
It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to pass. 

Once you're able to pass the test case, refactor your code.  Refactoring
regulary as you build your code will keep it clean and will allow you
to place certain parts of your code accordingly, so that it's easier to read
and any uneccessary code is removed to allow for .  At this point you test again
so that you know that the refactoring did not alter any existing functionality.
This is the process you want to repeat until your code is done.  
With TDD you can be sure that the new code will not break or degrade existing features. 

It's a foolproof method!  :)
